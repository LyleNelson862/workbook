## What is a pseudo class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
A pseudo class is a CSS class used for defining a special state of an element. The most common ones I will probably use are probably :link, :target, and :scope.
## What is specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?;
Specificity is the criteria that browsers use to determine which CSS property values within an element are the most relevant and therefore should be applied. Specificity benefits users because it saves time by allowing users to make changes to their project without having to go back and look for the original selector in order to delete it. It is much quicker and easier to just replace it with a different selector.
## What problems do you think you could run into if you overused the !important feature?
If you use the !important feature on multiple elements, then CSS will display those elements by their order of specificity. That means the more you use it the less power it has. Its like they say, if everything is important then nothing is important.

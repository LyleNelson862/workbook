## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?
You can write information from the console or from HTML. You should try writing it from HTML first, and if that doesn't work then you have to go into the console.
## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this be useful when debugging HTML?
Right click and click inspect to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS for your project. The console shows you some errors that are not found anywhere else.
## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
You can use the debugger statement. This statement suspends the execution of code and calls the debugging function if available.
